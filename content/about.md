Had a great experience while doing the amFOSS tasks. This is a site i created using hugo which was actually fun, though i couldn't add much in this website but will be working on it real soon as its really exciting to do.

While doing the tasks i learned so many new things which will seriously help me a lot in future.

Thank you amFOSS
